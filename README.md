# Parm ðŸ§€

Parm is a faux package/repository manager that allows you to install any program binary from github and will manage it for you.

Parm provides a lot of options on how you want to install/manage your software, including building from source, downloading a release binary, or even downloading a specific branch or commit of a repository.

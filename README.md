## Quick Start
To install Parm on Linux/macOS: run the following command:
```sh
# todo, likely something like curl -fsSL <install_script>.sh | sh
```

For Windows users:
```ps1
# todo, something like iex <script>
```

To use parm:
```sh
parm install <owner>/<repo> # installs a package
parm remove <owner>/<repo> # uninstalls a package
parm update <owner>/<repo> # to update a package
```

For more detailed install instructions, see [Installation](#install).

## Introduction

### What is Parm?
Parm is a cross-platform package manager that allows you to install any program off of GitHub via their REST API. Parm directly downloads binaries provided by GitHub repository releases and includes niceties such as symlinking binaries to PATH and checking for updates.

This means that Parm

- has zero root access & zero required dependencies
- requires no additional package maintainers
- receives new versions upstream instantly.
- is incredibly lightweight

### Disclaimers
> [!CAUTION]
> Parm uses the GitHub REST API to find and install packages. Theoretically, this means you can install any program off of GitHub, so ***YOU*** are responsible for the packages you install, since I don't maintain a registry of vetted packages.

> [!NOTE]
> Parm is *not* intended to replace your system/OS-level package manager (think apt, pacman, or anything that can install low-level libraries, tools, or services). In general, it is closer to programs like homebrew, as it is meant to install more high-level, user-facing applications such as neovim.


## Pre-requisites
1. *(optional)* Must have `objdump`, `grep` on Linux or `otool` on macOS installed and added to PATH
    - Parm may use these tools to search for potential dependencies on installed programs. 
        - Parm will not try to search for dependencies on Windows at the moment.
        - On Linux, `ldd` is not used since some implementations of it may execute the program to find dependencies. This is more accurate than using `objdump` or `readelf`, but poses a bigger security risk given the scope and design of this project.
    - `objdump`, `grep` and `otool` should already be installed and added to PATH on your machine. You can check this by running
    ```sh
    which objdump grep
    ```
    or
    ```sh
    which otool
    ```
2. *(optional)* Must have a **free** GitHub personal access token with access to PUBLIC repositories. Go [here](#adding-a-github-personal-access-token) to find out how to add an access token.

## Install
TODO

## Adding a GitHub Personal Access Token
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you DON'T have/want to use a GitHub personal access token, then you will be limited to 60 requests/hr instead of the 5000+ requests/hr with an API key. 
> There is nothing I can do about this and this is a limitation of the program's design and the GitHub API.

1. Add a personal access token (classic) by following [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic).
    - You can use a fine-grained personal access token if you want, but this is not tested properly. Check out the guide for that [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token).
2. Add the API key to your shell environment:
```sh
echo 'export GH_TOKEN=<your_token_here> >> ~/.bashrc'
```

- You can substitute `GH_TOKEN` with `GITHUB_TOKEN` or `PARM_GITHUB_TOKEN`
- You can also substitute `~/.bashrc` with your shell environment of choice (e.g. `~/.zshrc`)

3. Parm will automatically use your token from your shell's environment variable.
4. If Parm does not detect your token from your shell, you can set a fallback in the `github_api_token_fallback` in your config, which will be in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/parm/config.toml`

To use the `github_api_token_fallback` instead, run the following command (with parm installed):
```sh
parm config set github_api_token_fallback=<token>
```
5. If no token is found, it will default to non-authenticated GitHub REST API usage, which defaults to 60 requests/hr.

## Usage

| Command  | Flags | Description |
| ------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| `install` | `--release, --pre-release, --asset, --strict, --no-verify` | Installs a package. |
| `uninstall` |  | Uninstalls a package. |
| `update` | `--strict` | Updates a package. |
| `list` |  | Lists the currently installed packages. |
| `config` |  | Prints out the current config in parm's `config.toml` file. |
| `config set` |  | Sets a `key=value` pair for a configuration setting. |
| `config reset` | `--all` | Resets a `key=value` config setting back to its default. |
| `info` | `--get-upstream` | Retrieves information about a certain package. |

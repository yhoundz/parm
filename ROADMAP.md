# ROADMAP

Parm is still in a very early state, and breaking changes are to be expected. Additionally, a lot of features may not be implemented yet, or working as expected.

Below are a list of features and improvements that are planned for future releases (in no particular order):

- Allow users to be able to choose which asset to release if a direct match isn't found.
- Caching API calls or expensive operations (like listing installed packages)
- Better version management: Entails being able to install multiple versions at once and switching between them easily.
- Boostrapping: Allowing the user to upgrade or uninstall Parm itself without having to rerun the install script again and do it from within the CLI.
- Switching release channels: Allow the user to switch between the "Release" and "Pre-release" channels, changing how the update command behaves.
- Shell autocompletion.
